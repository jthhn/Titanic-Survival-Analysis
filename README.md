# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis Project

This is a beginner-friendly data analysis and visualization project using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**. The goal is to explore the Titanic dataset to understand passenger survival patterns based on factors like age, gender, class, and fare.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the built-in **Titanic dataset** from Seaborn. It contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Fare
- Embarked location
- Whether the passenger survived

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🎨
- Jupyter Notebook 🧪

## 🧠 What I Did
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Cleaned missing values (e.g., age, embarked, deck)
- Analyzed survival rates based on gender, class, age, and fare
- Visualized patterns using:
  - Bar plots
  - Box plots
  - Histograms
  - Heatmaps

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Survival count** by gender and class
- **Age distribution** of passengers
- **Box plot** of age vs class
- **Heatmap** showing correlations between numeric features

## 🎯 What I Learned
- How to clean and manipulate real-world data using Pandas
- How to visualize data with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- How to draw conclusions from visual patterns
- Basic data exploration and storytelling with data

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code
3. Run all cells and explore the data

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jthhn/Titanic-Survival-Analysis.git
